# drl_dp_project
This is a project implements deep reinforcement learning to Dynamic Pricing (DP) problem. The actor-critic methods used are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Dynamic pricing is crucial for any online trading platform to optimise revenue. Deep reinforcement learning research provides new capable solutions to this problem in the complex e-commerce environment. However, there is a lack of literature on the application of deep reinforcement learning methods for pricing problems in the travel industry.

This publication explores the potential of Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning algorithms applied to dynamic pricing for online lodging platforms. A simulated environment that mimics the trading context and user behaviour for pricing optimisation presents a challenge in a reinforcement learning context. We have successfully built pricing solutions using Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms with real-world data from the travel industry, achieving a ten per cent revenue increase. Moreover, we define an innovative environment simulation that integrates pricing elasticity models; we share hyper-parameter tuning insights and use standard metrics to benchmark model performance.

This github includes the environment simulator, A2C and PPO training files, and results notebook. The dataset is confidential from the business partner, but we described it in detail in the paper.
